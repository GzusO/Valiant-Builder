    {name:'Energy',displayFormat:'Energy [X]',description:'The energy it costs to use the ability. Abilities that don’t resolve immediately have use and resolution costs in the form [use cost] + [resolution cost] Energy. The use cost is spent upon using the ability, and the resolution cost is spent when the ability resolves. If only one cost is defined, that cost is the use cost and the resolution cost is 0. Abilities may include a variable x in their cost, which is decided by the user (must be at least 1). Effects that alter ability energy costs alter the final cost.'},
    {name:'Combat',displayFormat:'Combat',description:'Whether the ability can be used in combat. Combat abilities can be used outside of combat by converting turns to time at a ratio of 5 seconds per turn.'},

    {name:'Charged Action',displayFormat:'Charged Action [x]',description:'Charged action abilities resolve at the beginning of the user’s act phase (before equipped weapons can be swapped) x rounds after they are used.

If the trigger is Global, the ability can be used at the beginning or end of any phase or whenever another character uses or resolves an ability. When applied to non-combat abilities, the trigger is used in a similar way. Whenever the event defined by the trigger resolves, the ability may be used then (and only then).'},
    {name:'Stance',displayFormat:'Stance',description:'Abilities that can only be used before the begin phase of a round. The effects of stances are active for as long as they are maintained.

    {name:'Focus',displayFormat:'Focus [X]',description:'An ability that has continuous effects that must be actively maintained by the user using a focus slot. If the user takes x or more total energy damage during a single turn or becomes incapacitated while maintaining focus, the ability effects end. If no x is defined, focus cannot be lost due to energy damage. Focus abilities with a target only require the target to be valid until the ability resolves. Focus only needs to be maintained once the ability has resolved.'},
    {name:'Indirect',displayFormat:'Indirect',description:'An ability that is not blocked by obstacles between the user and the target. This allows abilities to target something as long as the target’s location is known, or range abilities with a shape to affect characters through barriers.'},

Ranged abilities can also target adjacent creatures unless otherwise specified. Range abilities with a shape must define that shape when targets would otherwise be declared. Any characters within the shape are considered targeted while they are within the shape’s bounds (these abilities do not fail to resolve if they have no targets). If a secondary range y is declared, use y as the range for drawing the shape and x as the range for placing the shape’s source. Otherwise, the user of the ability is the source and x is the shape range. Specific shapes and their rules can be found in section 3.1 (Ability Shapes).
