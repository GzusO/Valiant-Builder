    {name:'Energy',displayFormat:'Energy [X]',description:'The energy it costs to use the ability. Abilities that don’t resolve immediately have use and resolution costs in the form [use cost] + [resolution cost] Energy. The use cost is spent upon using the ability, and the resolution cost is spent when the ability resolves. If only one cost is defined, that cost is the use cost and the resolution cost is 0. Abilities may include a variable x in their cost, which is decided by the user (must be at least 1). Effects that alter ability energy costs alter the final cost.'},
    {name:'Combat',displayFormat:'Combat',description:'Whether the ability can be used in combat. Combat abilities can be used outside of combat by converting turns to time at a ratio of 5 seconds per turn.'},
    {name:"Action",displayFormat:'Action',description:"Abilities that can normally only be used during a character\'s act phase."},
    {name:'Attack Modifier',displayFormat:'Attack Modifier',description:'Abilities that can be used by a character to modify one of their attack abilities, applied when the attack ability is used (before selecting targets). The effects on an attack modifier exist during their triggering attack\'s contest and effect application, unless otherwise stated. Normally, only one attack modifier can be applied to an attack ability.'},
    {name:'Charged Action',displayFormat:'Charged Action [x], [Focus Y]',description:'Similar to an action, but with a delayed resolution. Charged action abilities that have been used but have yet to resolved are considered pending, with a pending value that starts at x. At the beginning of a character’s act phase, all of their pending values are reduced by 1 and the act phase is skipped. If a pending value is reduced to 0 at this time, the corresponding pending ability resolves. Some pending charge actions require focus to maintain (see the Focus tertiary tag) with the y value determining the energy damage threshold. If the character loses focus on a pending ability, the ability fails to resolve.'},
    {name:'Melee Counter',displayFormat:'[Melee] Counter',description:'Abilities that can be used by a character whenever an attack ability targeting them resolves. The effects of a counter exist during their triggering attack’s contest and effect application, unless otherwise stated. If a counter is marked as a melee counter, the ability may only use melee attack abilities as the trigger.'},
    {name:'Counter',displayFormat:'[Melee] Counter',description:'Abilities that can be used by a character whenever an attack ability targeting them resolves. The effects of a counter exist during their triggering attack’s contest and effect application, unless otherwise stated. If a counter is marked as a melee counter, the ability may only use melee attack abilities as the trigger.'},
    {name:'Reaction',displayFormat:'Reaction',description:'Abilities that rely on triggers to be used. The triggers and effects of reaction abilities are formatted as trigger: effect. If the trigger is Global, the ability can be used at the beginning or end of any phase or whenever another character uses or resolves an ability. When applied to non-combat abilities, the trigger is used in a similar way. Whenever the event defined by the trigger resolves, the ability may be used then (and only then).'},
    {name:'Stance',displayFormat:'Stance',description:'Abilities that can only be used before the begin phase of a round. The effects of stances are active for as long as they are maintained. The cost of the stance must be paid again before the begin phase of each round to maintain the stance effects. Stances require a focus slot to maintain. A character may only focus on one stance at any time. Focus on stances cannot be dropped by the user.'},
    {name:'Transformation',displayFormat:'Transformation',description:'Abilities that can only be used before the begin phase of a round. The effects of transformations are active until the combat ends. A character may only have one transformation active at any time.'},
    {name:'Attack',displayFormat:'Attack',description:'An ability that involves an attack contest between the user and a target or targets.'},
    {name:'Focus',displayFormat:'Focus [X]',description:'An ability that has continuous effects that must be actively maintained by the user using a focus slot. If the user takes x or more total energy damage during a single turn or becomes incapacitated while maintaining focus, the ability effects end. If no x is defined, focus cannot be lost due to energy damage. Focus abilities with a target only require the target to be valid until the ability resolves. Focus only needs to be maintained once the ability has resolved.'},
    {name:'Indirect',displayFormat:'Indirect',description:'An ability that is not blocked by obstacles between the user and the target. This allows abilities to target something as long as the target’s location is known, or range abilities with a shape to affect characters through barriers.'},
    {name:'Limited',displayFormat:'Limited [X]',description:'An ability that can only be used x times (regardless of whether the ability resolves). Uses can be restored by certain abilities, most commonly the rest ability.'},
    {name:'Melee',displayFormat:'Melee',description:'An action that can only target anything within reach. Normally, only adjacent tiles are within reach.'},
    {name:'Range',displayFormat:'Range [X] [Shape] [Y]',description:'An ability that can target something up to x tiles away. Ranged abilities can also target adjacent creatures unless otherwise specified. Range abilities with a shape must define that shape when targets would otherwise be declared. Any characters within the shape are considered targeted while they are within the shape’s bounds (these abilities do not fail to resolve if they have no targets). If a secondary range y is declared, use y as the range for drawing the shape and x as the range for placing the shape’s source. Otherwise, the user of the ability is the source and x is the shape range. Specific shapes and their rules can be found in section 3.1 (Ability Shapes). A ranged ability user must normally have unobstructed line-of-sight to their target. Range abilities with a shape must have an unobstructed line-of-sight from the shape’s source to the target.'},
    {name:'Recharge',displayFormat:'Recharge [X]',description:'If a character uses a recharge ability, they suffer recharging x when the ability resolves.'},
    {name:'Slow',displayFormat:'Slow',description:'An ability that can only be used during a character\'s act phase and only if they had not moved during their turn.'},
    {name:'Blitz',displayFormat:'Blitz',description:'An ability that cannot be used as a trigger for other abilities. This includes the effects of this ability, such as energy reductions, ailments caused, or movement performed.'},

Its range abilities can be used x times, after which the weapon’s range abilities become unusable. Commonly, these uses are recharged by using the rest ability. When determining range for a projectile weapon’s range abilities, any downward tiles do not have to be counted. For instance, a gunner atop a wall using an ability with a range of 10 can target another character 10 tiles north and 10 tiles below them.'},
